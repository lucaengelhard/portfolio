the comiccon stuttgart is an annual comic and popculture convention. small artists, cosplayers and big movie stars attend. in this project we rebranded the comiccon, modified the name and gave the whole event are more interesting and consistent look.

the base element of the rebranding is the double "c" for **c**omic and **c**on. as comics initially were hand-drawn, the logo doesn't have straight, clean lines, but slight imperfections that make it less sterile.
based on the logo we also created a typeface that is used in big display situations like posters, flags and the landing page of the website.
