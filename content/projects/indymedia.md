Indymedia is a portal for (sometimes anonymous) publication of left-wing content. in a course for university we redesigned the corporate identity of the website and reworked the structure and look of the site. in the end we coded a working prototype of most of the pages and created a backend in nodejs with express.

the goal was to rework the look and feel of the website from a hard to read and trashy looking blog-site to more of a magazine-like style.
for that we analysed existing websites of newspapers and magazines and took ui-elements from them and incorporated those into our site.

the landing page for example has a header with the newest featured articles and then current articles sorted by topic:

another important part of the new website is the map and event overview. here you can search for events and institutions in a certain area:

we created a desktop and a mobile version of the site:
